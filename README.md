WhileAndDoWhileLoopExamples

This project demonstrates the use of while and do-while loops in C#. While loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true, while do-while loops execute the code block at least once before checking the condition.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Counting with while Loop: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.
    Input Validation with do-while Loop: Repeatedly asking for a positive number until the user enters one.
    Summing with while Loop: Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
    Repeating a Message with do-while Loop: Printing a message a specific number of times.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Using while loop for counting and summing values.
    Using do-while loop for input validation to ensure the user enters a valid input.
    Printing a message multiple times with a do-while loop.

Example Output

    Counting from 1 to 5 using while loop:
    1 2 3 4 5

    Enter a positive number: -3
    Enter a positive number: 5
    You entered a positive number: 5

    Sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15

    Printing message using do-while loop:
    Hello, World!
    Hello, World!
    Hello, World!

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file to see the examples of while and do-while loops in action.

Purpose

This project is intended for beginners who want to understand how to use while and do-while loops in C# for various repetitive tasks and input validations.
